# Comparative-analysis-of-SRP
Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae (SRP) are group of two different genus of pathogenic bacteria; Pectobacterium and Dickeya. And this project is all about comparing difference in the genetic constitution and functionality of various strains of these genus making them either competitive or coopertive with each other.

## Analyses included
- Pfam domain identification using HMM based alignment of protein sequences
- BLAST based annotation against the Virulence Factor Database, followed by genes feature contribution analysis
- KEGG Orthology (KO) based profiling of Type secretion systems
- Construction of gene presence absence matrices for comparative analyses
- Characterization of aerobactin mediated iron acquisition iuc operons 
- Analysis of bacterial communication system focusing on ExpI/ExpR and LuxS pathways

## Diagrams created
- PCA loading plots
- Heatmaps
- Amino acid Divergence plots

## Computing environment
- HPC: Tempest (SLURM)
- Conda environments provided in `environment/`
